# Goodreads

> Baker Moran

## Why I did this

I wanted to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails, so I figured a good way to do that would be to make a clone of another site ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)). A class I took in school had us do a similar project with Instagram, so I decided to change it up and do Goodreads for this project. Cloning a site is a great way to learn a new framework or language, because it allows you to explore how to write the code rather than planning design or modeling. For this project I focused mostly on the backend, and let the front end be mostly functional rather than pretty. I was able to create a replica of Goodreads that approximates 90% of the actual websites functionality by spending about 8 hours on it. The real Goodreads is actually built with Rails, so I wonder how close I got to their actual modeling.

As I love to read, I along with some of my friends frequently use Goodreads. The one thing I hear from everyone that uses Goodreads, is that the app is terrible. Though it has improved in recent years, the UI is still not pretty, and functionality is limited. Goodreads is severly underinvested in and undercapitalized for Amazon, which explains how I was able to create a working version of it in a short amount of time.

## What I found

Rails makes it so easy to build a website. Almost too easy. If I had no experience with other web frameworks, there would be so much magic going on that I wouldn't know what was actually happening. It also does not lend itself well to debugging code. When you write so little code, it's hard to see where things are going wrong. My takeaways are that if I just need a simple backend, Rails is a super easy and fast way to get one up and running. However, my first choice is still a framework that is more explicit in the actual code than behind the scenes magic. With a big app, I think it would be challenging to onboard new developers without Rails experience.

I learned a lot about how to use Rails from investing no more than a days work in a simple project. I love creating things, even if it's something that already exists, because I love to learn. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this because it taught me a lot about Rails and web development. I may even continue to maintain this to some degree just for the fun of it.

## Resources

I found [this book](https://3rd-edition.railstutorial.org/book) by Michael Hartl to be very helpful in learning Rails. I stumbled upon it after I had already started, but some of the code from later parts like signup/login is taken from and inspired by this book. What I found especially helpful where the parts about testing in Rails, and migrations in Rails. There are newer editions, but this  one seemed to be free while the others did not. Anyone looking to learn Rails should give this a read.
